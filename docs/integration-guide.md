# ReScript Struct for library maintainers

If you're a library maintainer, you can use **rescript-struct** to get information about described structures. The most common use case is building type-safe schemas e.g for REST APIs, databases, and forms.

Documentation for this feature is work in progress, for now, you can use `S.resi` file as a reference and the [rescript-json-schema](https://github.com/DZakh/rescript-json-schema)'s source code.
