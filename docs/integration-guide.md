# ReScript Schema for library maintainers

If you're a library maintainer, you can use **rescript-schema** as a building block for your tools. The most common use case is a type-safe schema for REST APIs, databases, forms, etc.

Documentation for this feature is work in progress, for now, you can use `S.resi` file as a reference and the [rescript-json-schema](https://github.com/DZakh/rescript-json-schema)'s source code.
